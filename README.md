## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The problem of items and belongings piling up is something that most families and homeowners face. The possibility to make both space and money by disposing the belongings is more ideal than just getting rid of them. A successful solution would be a marketplace that can effectively connect homeowners in need of making space in their homes by lending/renting belongings to possible buyers. 

## PROJECT GOALS
### Goals & Objectives:
The main goal for this website project is to promote the idea of “giving”/sharing, and selling instead of resorting to throwing items away. The option to borrow/rent items allows for better sustainability and benefits both the client and the lender by saving money and overall resources. The website will provide an easy solution for a client in need of purchasing or renting an item, and looking for possible sellers to get in contact with. The website allows the client and sellers to check the reputation and reviews of each other to make sure they are trustworthy, easy to work with users.

## LINKING WITH AN API
### Amazon Product Advertising APIs:

Amazon Product Advertising APIs provide many operations that can be used in our project. For example, the ItemSearch operation, that has many parameters that returns an Item object with item attributes. This operation can be used to get the prices of the items in the item’s page. It could be useful for users who want to compare between the prices of these items as the website is mainly designed to sell or rent out used items, it would be useful to know the price of the item when it’s new.
Also Amazon provides another operation for similarity lookup. This operation could be useful to show the buyer or renter similar items at different price points. Which can help the user to decide if they want to rent or buy the used item or maybe get a similar item that is cheaper.
